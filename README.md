Unity-Scenedump-Xml is a configurable Unity Editor extension that generates an XML representation of a Scene 
hierarchy. 
(Example output: 
[Terse](http://github.com/jskubick/unity-scenedump-xml-project/blob/master/samples/scene-terse.xml)
or
[Verbose](http://github.com/jskubick/unity-scenedump-xml-project/blob/master/samples/scene-verbose.xml)
)

# IMPORTANT

This repo has a submodule. 
If you don't know what this means, make sure you actually **read** the [Installation section](#Installation),
or it's probably *not* going to work.

# Installation

**IMPORTANT!** This project uses a submodule. If you don't know what that means, read the directions and follow them carefully (esp. the **--recursive** flag).

How to clone this example project **and** the files needed for the Editor extension in one shot:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jskubick/unity-scenedump-xml-project.git`

Note the **--recursive** flag. It's important. If you omit it, you'll likely end up with an empty directory named Assets/Editor/unity-scenedump-xml.

If you screw up, see the [unity-scenedump-xml submodule's README.md file](https://github.com/jskubick/unity-scenedump-xml.git#Troubleshooting). 

If you want to use the extension with your own project, instructions are in the [unity-scenedump-xml submodule's README.md file](https://github.com/jskubick/unity-scenedump-xml.git#Installation)
